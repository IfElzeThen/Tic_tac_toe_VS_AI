the easiest way to try a game is to:
1. find the online haskell compiler ([Suggestion 1; ](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_haskell_compiler)[Suggestion 2](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_haskell_online.php)).
2. copy the code from the repository into the compiler.
3. set the entry point ```main = startGame```
4. run the program to start the game

to make a move, input row and column numbers (0 based) in the console. they should be separated by enter
